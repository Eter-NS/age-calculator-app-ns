## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS - to improve the style workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I started my journey with the Tailwind CSS and revitalised some of the information about Vue.
Also, I've discovered more about logic in Date measures, which may be interesting for some features in other projects.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learning more about Vue because of its simplicity, but I'd like to challenge myself and write this application using Angular (for the job portfolio). The Tailwind CSS framework charmed me of its power, but I don't think I'll use it for multiple of the same components f.e. inputs etc., because of code redundancy.
